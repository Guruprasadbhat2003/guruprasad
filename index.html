      <h1>Our journey From Film Plans to Fun Audio Stories!!</h1>
      <p1><b>
        Our journey began with big dreams of creating a short film together. And we even started off doing a cool movie together and also we discussed about that. We were all excited and full of ideas, ready to bring our story to life. But as we looked at our schedules and the time we had, we realized making a film might be too hard for us. And we didn’t have enough time to execute that So, we decided to try live podcasting!</b>
        </p1>
      <img src="dhar.webp" id="centered-image">
      <p2><b>Instead of feeling disappointed we saw the idea of doing live podcast Podcasting seemed like a cool idea. We could tell stories and share our thoughts, but in a different way. Live podcast sounded really fun. It meant we could share stories of alexander the great from Greece and Chandragupta mourya from india. we knew we could make something amazing together. We talked about what topics we were interested in exploring. We sat together after class and discussed about our script and how we are going to present it. After some discussion, we settled on the idea of diving into the stories of Chandragupta Maurya and Alexander the Great from the classical ages. We thought it would be fun to learn more about these historical figures and share what we discovered with our listeners. Once we had our topic, we did research. We watched movies, read book, and documentaries. We took notes, discussed what we found interesting, and started to shape our script together. We wanted our podcast to be informative but also entertaining, so we looked for stories that would engage our audience. We practiced our own lines and tried to find the right balance between being informative and fun.
      
      When the day came to present our podcast, we were all excited. We set up our background. We shared our opinions on the movies we watched by adding in jokes and commentary along the way.

      <p3><b>We connected both the legends from different countries by creating a fictional and non fictional stories, it was more like a debate between us.
        Midway through our presentation, my friends surprised everyone by showcasing an ad they had created during their free time.</b></p3>
        <img src="7.webp" id="centered-image">
        <p3><b>We had so much fun making the surprise ad! It was unexpected, but we went for it and had a blast. Being spontaneous and creative together was really cool, and we laughed a lot. It turned out great! The unexpected twist injected into our podcast. It was a moment of pure joy. It was a lot of fun, and we couldn’t stop laughing at some points.
        Our unexpected journey from planning a short film to creating a podcast with enjoyable advertisement .It taught us to being open to new opportunities. As we look back on our adventure, we’re reminded of the joy that comes from working together as a team, laughing, and having fun.

        Looking back on our journey, we’re really proud of what we accomplished. Even though our original plans didn’t work out, we didn’t let that stop us from trying something new .Our podcast may have started as a backup plan, but it turned into a fun.

      <h1>Traveling Through Time: From Ancient Civilizations to Medieval Adventures</h1>
      <p><b>As we got ready for our next assignments, we wanted to explore history in a fun and exciting way.
         We decided to look at how things changed from a long time ago to the Middle Ages. 
         Together—Dharani, Irfan, Hrishikesh, Radhi.—we chose two big topics to focus on: the Chola Empire in South Asia and the Crusades around the world.
        </b></p>
      <p><b>
        We started by doing research, which was like going on a treasure hunt for information. We read books, checked out websites, and watched videos to learn as much as we could about the Chola Empire and the Crusades. Each new thing we discovered felt like finding a hidden treasure, and it made us even more excited to share what we learned with our classmates.
      </b></p>
      
      <p><b>Once we had all our facts, we wanted to come up with a fun way to present them. That’s when we got the idea for a game show! Instead of just talking at our classmates, we wanted to get them involved and make learning about history feel like a game.</b></p>
      <img src="14.webp" id="centered-image">
      
      <p><b>So, here’s how it worked: teams would answer questions about the Chola Empire and the Crusades, and for every question they got right, they’d earn points. But we wanted to make it even more exciting, so we added a challenge. Teams had to build a pyramid out of paper cups,and the first team to finish would get a chance to answer a question with a little hint to help them out.</b></p>
      <img src="78.webp" id="centered-image">
      <p><b>Now, here’s the fun part: if a team got a question wrong, they’d have to do something silly as a punishment. It could be anything from singing a funny song to doing a little dance. We thought it would make the game even more hilarious and keep everyone laughing.

      <img src="89.webp" id="centered-image">
      
      <p><b>As we finish up, learning about the Chola Empire and the Crusades was really fun. We worked together and had a great time exploring history. Now, we’re excited for more adventures in learning!
